### STM32-Lamp

STM32F103 based dimmable lamp with timed sunrise effect

This project was made in conjunciton with a constant current led driver board I made to drive a set of bare power LEDs. The goal was to have manual control over brightness most of the time while also having the light wake me up by slowly fading to full brightness at a specified alarm time.

The light also fades when turning it on and off, since I'd already implemented PWM I thought *why not*.
